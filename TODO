In no particular order.

* Write tests!

* Extract a lot more metadata about updates; changelogs, dependencies...

* Implement some kind of matching patterns for version strings a package supports. This is to avoid version like '20100306' and that sort of crazy things.

* Implement package, repository and category options thus enabling us to only check for updates for the matched packages.

* The Freshmeat/Freecode remote uses a auth key. This auth key is limited to 600 calls per auth code per hour (http://help.freecode.com/kb/api-7/data-api-introduction). This could be worked-around by getting more auth keys, or we could ask the friendly people at Freecode to give us an auth key with no, or high, limit. As of now there is around 1000 packages which have freshmeat as remote.

* Implement the following remotes:
    * RubyForge
    * SourceForge
    * Vim Scripts

* Implement the following reports:
    * HTML
    * Mail
    * IRC
